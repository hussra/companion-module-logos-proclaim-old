## Logos Proclaim

This module provides the ability for Companion to control [Logos Proclaim](https://proclaim.logos.com/),
a cloud-based presentation software built specifically for churches.

This module has been developed and tested with Proclaim version 4.0 and Companion 3.1.2.

First ensure Proclaim's local server is enabled. To do so, open Proclaim and go to **Settings > Remote**
and click **Enable**. If you are running Proclaim on Windows, you may be prompted to allow Proclaim to
make a firewall exception for the port it needs to expose to allow remote control.

If you are running Companion and Proclaim on **different computers**,  scroll down to **Network Control
Password** in the Proclaim settings dialog and choose a password.
